**VHDL-3D_PONG_ARCHITECTURES**

This is a hardware description for the architectures that I created for a bigger project called 3D_PONG. The project consists of a fully playable 3D pong game realised with a FPGA and additional hardware. The FGPA serves as the central hardware while the addionatal hardware consists of periphirals like a wireless controller module, the controllers themself and a VGA Connector extension board. This repo contains the architecture for the central control unit with game code and the graphical processing unit with sprites.

The repo was originally created to store my school assignment but I also figured someone else might have a use for this.

The source files are located in [projectname].srcs/sources.

The software used for this project is Vivado 2014.3 and the configuration is made for the basys 3(Artix 7 FPGA) development board.

**Technical specifications pending!**
